Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Before pushing code:
1. Run `npm run lint` and fix any reported issues.
2. Run `npm run lint:types` to ensure type correctness.
3. Run `npm run build` to confirm bundling succeeds.
4. Optionally run `npm run format` to enforce style.

Upload your Screeps code with `npm run upload` after building.
